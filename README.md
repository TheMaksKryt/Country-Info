# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This is a simple web application template built with **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite** to help you get started with development quickly. It uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs (Single File Components). Check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
